Q1. How to query a database to display all the tables in it.
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/205736/get-list-of-all-tables-in-oracle

A) if you have dba access (i.e dba grants acess to 'SELECT ANY DICTIONARY' PRIVILEGE OR 'SELECT_CATALOG_ROLE" ROLE
then use 
  SELECT OWNER,TABLE_NAME FROM DBA_TABLES
  
B) if you do not have access to DBA_TABLES, use ALL_TABLES view. ALL_tables contain the tables that your account has access
SELECT OWNER,TABLE_NAME FROM ALL_TABLES
  
C) If you are concerned with tables that you OWN, not those that you have access to, you can use, USER_TABLES
  SELECT TABLE_NAME FROM USER_TABLES;
  Here there won't be owner column, because the owner is you.
 
  Keep in mind that some "tables" may actually be "views" so you can also try running something like:
  SELECT view_name FROM all_views;
  -----
  Legacy code is by use of TAB,DICT,TABS,CAT
  TAB,CAT VIEWS show info about tables that are in user's recycle bin. while,
  [DBA|ALL|USER]_TABLES VIEWS all filter those in recycle bin.
  DICT combines tables and synonyms and doesn't tell you who owns the object.
  CAT show infor about materialized view logs with a TABLE_TYPE of 'TABLE', which you really don't want.
